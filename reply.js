    "about" : "OpenAI is a research lab founded in 2015 that focuses on developing and promoting advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics. One of the lab's most notable achievements is GPT-3, the largest language model ever created with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 has the ability to generate human-like text and can be used for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and translation. Another product from OpenAI is text-davinci-003, an open-source natural language processing library based on the GPT-3 model. This library can be used for a variety of tasks, including text summarization, question answering, and text generation.\n" +
